Hi 

I am a field service engineer who one day injured himself at work and now spends most of the day 
trying to maintain and manage the pains.
My background was mainly focused on Electrical and Electronic service work in house R'n'D.
Building of new systems for contract work and repair and maintaining operations.
I recently purchased a 3D printer to change my focus in life, I now find it has taken over.
It started of as a hobby after a tedious learning curve. Now I tend to design and build things for projects around the house.
Unfortunately each project takes me a long time to complete due to my disability.
I now find that the projects I want to reasearch have Programming involved.
I have very little programming knoledge, from my schooling in electronics.
Also in Basic programming.
I am hoping to learn more as I go with the help of the GitHub community.
